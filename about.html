          Caracol is an award winning worker cooperative based in New York City. Caracol Language Cooperative mission is to advance Language Justice for immigrant and multilingual communities and to offer high quality language services of
          interpretation and translation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2012 we decided to take matter into our own hands confronting precarious economic situations and embraced the cooperative model. Our aim is to build sustainable and dignified jobs while creating community wealth and dignified language
          services for our migrant communities to better participate in society. In the past two years since our incorporation as an LLC we have faced unsurmountable capacity issues, administrative and financial challenges that have taken us to
          collectively decide to close our operations as a worker cooperative business.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have served our communities for the past eight years 2012- 2010 and we will continue to strive to create multilingual spaces where people can fully express themselves in the language of their choice. The cooperative is closing its
          operations as a cooperative business in May 29 2020.
          *Workers will continue to offer language services as independent contractors*
          Caracolâ€™s workers are highly skilled with extensive experience in interpretation and translation services. They also offer consultant services to train staff at organizations and initiatives to acquire the knowledge to create multilingual
          spaces that better serve multilingual communities. The reach of our services mainly in New York city, the Tri-state area (NY, NJ, CT) and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are knowledgeable in all matters related to interpretation, translation, coordination of events, management of interpretation equipment will continue to offer interpretation and translation services as individual contractors.
        </p>
        <p>
